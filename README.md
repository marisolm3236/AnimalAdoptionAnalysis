# Question we set out to answer: What factors affect how long it takes for a Dog to get adopted once they are in the shelter?
# 1) What are the most common outcomes across all animals?
# 2) Does Dog age affect outcome type? Do older dogs spend more time in the shelter before getting adopted?
# 3) Do certain Dog breeds spend more time in the shelter before getting adopted?
# 4) Is there a date or time period that more Dogs are adopted more often?
